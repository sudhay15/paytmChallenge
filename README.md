#The task is to create a ranking list for merchants depending upon various criterias. A merchant score is created using normalisation and z-scoring. 
# criterias used for ranking the merchants
   -> Number of orders
   -> Revenue
   -> Difference between actual selling price and MRP
   -> Shipping speed
   -> Order Cancels
   -> Order returns
  
  # Interesting discoveries
  
  # There were a few merchants who sold products with selling price higher than the Quoted Price. - These Merchants also suffered from high cancellations and returns.
       -> The list is also attached as "invalid_sales.csv"
